# Token System Compatibility Transition Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the process for transitioning from the old token system to the new one using the compatibility layer as a bridge. The goal is to provide a smooth migration path without breaking existing functionality.

## Phase 1: Compatibility Layer (Current Phase)

**Status: In Progress**

We've created a compatibility layer that maps the old token variables to the new ones. This allows both systems to coexist during the transition period.

### Implementation Details

1. The compatibility layer is defined in `src/styles/design-system/_compatibility.scss`
2. It imports the new token system and creates aliases to the old token names
3. The main entry point `src/styles/design-system/index.scss` imports this compatibility layer

### Usage During This Phase

- Existing code continues to work with the old token names
- New code should use the new token names directly
- All stylesheets should be updated to import from the new entry point: `@import 'design-system/index';`

## Phase 2: Gradual Migration (Next)

**Timeline: 2-3 weeks**

The migration script has identified high-impact tokens that should be prioritized. During this phase, we'll gradually update references to the old tokens.

### Migration Process

1. Update high-impact components first (based on token usage analysis)
2. Replace direct color values with token variables
3. Update typography and spacing tokens
4. Update component-specific tokens

### Tracking Progress

We'll track the migration progress with the following metrics:

- Percentage of old token references that have been migrated
- Number of files still using old token references
- Number of components fully migrated

## Phase 3: Deprecation Warnings (Future)

**Timeline: After Phase 2 is 90% complete**

Once most of the codebase has been migrated, we'll add deprecation warnings to the compatibility layer:

```scss
@warn "Token $primary-color is deprecated. Use $color-primary-500 instead.";
```

This will help identify any remaining usage of old tokens during development.

## Phase 4: Final Removal (Future)

**Timeline: Next major version release**

Once we're confident that all references have been migrated:

1. Remove the compatibility layer
2. Update documentation to only reference the new token system
3. Remove any remaining references to old tokens

## Testing Strategy

### During Migration

1. Visual regression testing should be performed on all components after migration
2. Test both light and dark themes
3. Verify all components render correctly in different states (hover, focus, disabled)

### Component Test Checklist

For each component being migrated, verify:

- [ ] Visual appearance matches the original design
- [ ] Theme switching works correctly
- [ ] All states (hover, focus, disabled) function properly
- [ ] Responsive behavior is maintained

## Rollback Plan

If issues are detected during migration:

1. The compatibility layer ensures old tokens still work
2. If critical issues occur, revert specific component changes
3. Flag tokens that cause issues for special handling
