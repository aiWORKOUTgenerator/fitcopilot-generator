# SavedWorkoutsTab Migration Testing Checklist

## üìã Overview

This comprehensive testing checklist ensures that every phase of the SavedWorkoutsTab migration maintains functionality, performance, and user experience. Each section must be validated before proceeding to the next migration phase.

## üéØ Testing Principles

### Core Testing Standards
1. **Zero Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality must work exactly as before
2. **Performance Preservation**: No degradation in load times or responsiveness
3. **Accessibility Maintenance**: All accessibility features must remain functional
4. **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Consistent behavior across supported browsers

### Testing Methodology
- **Before/After Comparison**: Document behavior before migration, verify identical behavior after
- **Automated Testing**: Unit tests for services, integration tests for components
- **Manual Testing**: User workflows and edge cases
- **Performance Testing**: Load times, memory usage, and responsiveness
