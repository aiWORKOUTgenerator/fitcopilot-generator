# Profile API Integration Fix

## Issue Summary
The profile form "Next" button was not storing data when navigating between steps. Users could fill out forms but nothing was being saved to the backend API, even though the API endpoints were working correctly.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem
The `useProfileForm` hook was trying to call functions that didn't exist in the ProfileContext:

1. ❌ `saveDraftUserProfile` - function doesn't exist
2. ❌ `updateUserProfile` - function doesn't exist  
3. ❌ `isUpdating` - property doesn't exist
4. ❌ `isSavingDraft` - property doesn't exist
5. ❌ `completedSteps` - property doesn't exist

### What Actually Exists
The ProfileContext only provides:
- ✅ `updateProfile` - for saving profile data
- ✅ `state.loading` - for loading state
- ✅ `state.error` - for error handling

## Fix Applied

### 1. Updated Hook Dependencies
**Before:**
```typescript
const { profile, updateUserProfile, saveDraftUserProfile, isUpdating, isSavingDraft, error, completedSteps } = useProfile();
```

**After:**
```typescript
const { state, updateProfile, clearError } = useProfile();
const { profile, loading, error } = state;
```

### 2. Added Local State Management
```typescript
// Local state for tracking completed steps and draft saving
const [completedSteps, setCompletedSteps] = useState<number[]>([]);
const [isSavingDraft, setIsSavingDraft] = useState(false);
```

### 3. Fixed Auto-Save Mechanism
**Before (broken):**
```typescript
await saveDraftUserProfile(formState.formData, formState.currentStep);
```

**After (working):**
```typescript
setIsSavingDraft(true);

// Create draft data with profileComplete: false
const draftData = {
  ...formState.formData,
  profileComplete: false
};

await updateProfile(draftData);

// Mark current step as completed
setCompletedSteps(prev => 
  prev.includes(formState.currentStep) 
    ? prev 
    : [...prev, formState.currentStep]
);
```

### 4. Fixed Final Submission
```typescript
// Mark the profile as complete before submitting
const updatedData: PartialUserProfile = {
  ...formState.formData,
  profileComplete: true
};

await updateProfile(updatedData);

// Mark final step as completed
setCompletedSteps(prev => 
  prev.includes(formState.currentStep) 
    ? prev 
    : [...prev, formState.currentStep]
);
```

## Files Modified
- `src/features/profile/hooks/useProfileForm.ts`

## Results

### ✅ Fixed Issues
- **Data Persistence**: Form data now saves on step navigation
- **Auto-Save**: Each step automatically saves as draft when user clicks "Next"
- **Step Completion**: Visual indicators show which steps are completed and saved
- **Final Submission**: "Save Profile" button properly saves with `profileComplete: true`
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during save operations
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if save fails (still allows navigation)

### ✅ User Experience Improvements
- **Visual Feedback**: Users see saving indicators and completed step badges
- **Data Safety**: No data loss when navigating between steps
- **Progressive Saving**: Each step is saved independently
- **Completion Tracking**: Clear visual indication of progress

### ✅ API Integration
- **Correct Endpoints**: Uses existing `updateProfile` API correctly
- **Draft vs Final**: Distinguishes between draft saves (`profileComplete: false`) and final submission (`profileComplete: true`)
- **Error Recovery**: Continues to work even if individual saves fail

## Testing Verification
- ✅ Build successful with no compilation errors
- ✅ API endpoints confirmed working (from user's test results)
- ✅ Form validation working correctly
- ✅ Step navigation with auto-save functional
- ✅ Completed step tracking operational

## Impact
This fix resolves a critical user-facing issue where profile data was being lost during form completion. Users can now confidently fill out their profiles knowing their progress is automatically saved at each step.
