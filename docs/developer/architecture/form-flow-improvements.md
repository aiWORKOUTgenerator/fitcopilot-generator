# Form Flow Improvements

## Overview

We've improved the form flow architecture by implementing a unified state management system using the `FormFlowContext`. This change addresses several issues in the previous implementation:

1. **State Fragmentation**: Previously, form flow state was distributed across multiple components and hooks, causing potential race conditions and state inconsistencies during transitions.

2. **Missing Transition Guards**: The old implementation lacked proper validation of step transitions, allowing invalid state changes.

3. **Progress Indicator Desynchronization**: Progress tracking was not consistently synchronized with actual request status.

4. **Error Handling and Recovery**: Error states weren't properly propagated through the multi-step form flow.

## Key Components

### FormFlowContext

The new `FormFlowContext` provides a unified state management system for the multi-step form flow, with these key features:

- **Centralized Step Management**: Tracks the current form step and ensures valid transitions
- **Preview Mode Handling**: Manages the preview state that was previously isolated
- **Progress Tracking**: Better progress simulation with more accurate feedback
- **Error Propagation**: Consistent error handling across all form steps
- **Form Step Persistence**: State preservation between sessions

### Enhanced WorkoutRequestForm

The `WorkoutRequestForm` component has been updated to:

1. Contain its own `FormFlowProvider` for encapsulated state management
2. Use the `derivedStep` value to determine which step component to render
3. Synchronize with the workout generator status through `setGenerationStatus`
4. Provide realistic progress feedback during generation
5. Use the new `cancelGeneration` method for proper API request abortion

## Implementation Details

### Step Transition Guards

The `canTransitionTo` function ensures valid form step transitions:

```typescript
function canTransitionTo(
  currentStep: FormSteps,
  targetStep: FormSteps,
  isGenerating: boolean
): boolean {
  // Block transitions during generation
  if (isGenerating && targetStep !== 'generating' && targetStep !== 'completed') {
    return false;
  }
  
  // Define valid step transitions
  const validTransitions: Record<FormSteps, FormSteps[]> = {
    'input': ['preview', 'generating'],
    'preview': ['input', 'generating'],
    'generating': ['input', 'completed'],
    'completed': ['input']
  };
  
  return validTransitions[currentStep].includes(targetStep);
}
```

### Enhanced Progress Tracking

Progress simulation has been improved to provide more accurate feedback:

- Initial progress indicators for different phases (starting: 5%, submitting: 15%)
- Gradual progress that slows down as it approaches 95%
- Proper cleanup of intervals to prevent memory leaks

### Error Synchronization

Errors from the workout generator are now properly synchronized with form flow:

```typescript
// Sync error messages
if (generatorErrorMessage) {
  setError(generatorErrorMessage);
}
```

### Form Flow State Persistence

The form step and preview mode are now persisted between sessions:

```typescript
// Save current step and preview mode whenever they change
useEffect(() => {
  persistence.saveData({
    currentStep: state.currentStep,
    isPreviewMode: state.isPreviewMode
  });
}, [state.currentStep, state.isPreviewMode, persistence]);
```

## Benefits

These improvements provide several key benefits:

1. **Improved Reliability**: Form flow transitions are now predictable and consistent.
2. **Better User Experience**: More accurate progress reporting and error feedback.
3. **Enhanced Testing**: Isolated form flow state makes unit testing easier.
4. **Improved Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns between form flow and API integration.
5. **Stronger Resilience**: Better handling of edge cases like cancelled requests.

## Migration Guide

If you're extending or customizing the workout generation form flow, here are key changes to be aware of:

1. Use `useFormFlow` to access form flow state and actions
2. The `derivedStep` property provides the current UI step while considering preview mode
3. Use helper methods like `goToInputStep`, `goToPreviewStep` for common transitions
4. Progress updates now accept both direct values and callback functions

## Examples

### Accessing Form Flow State

```tsx
import { useFormFlow } from '../../context/FormFlowContext';

function MyComponent() {
  const { 
    state: { currentStep, progress },
    goToPreviewStep,
    setProgress
  } = useFormFlow();
  
  // ...component implementation
}
```

### Updating Progress with a Callback

```tsx
// Increment progress by 5%
setProgress(prev => Math.min(prev + 5, 95));
```

### Handling Step Transitions

```tsx
const handleContinue = () => {
  if (validateForm()) {
    goToPreviewStep();
  }
};
```
