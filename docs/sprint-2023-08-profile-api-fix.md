# Sprint: Profile API Fix

## Overview

This sprint focused on resolving an issue with the Profile API where profile data was not being properly saved due to a mismatch between frontend and backend data format expectations. The frontend was sending profile data wrapped in a `profile` object (e.g., `{ "profile": { ...data } }`), but the backend expected direct access to the fields.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Backend API Modifications

#### ProfileEndpoints.php
- Added functionality to extract profile data from a wrapper object if present
- Maintained backward compatibility for direct format requests
- Updated to follow API Design Guidelines

```php
// Extract profile data from wrapper if present (following API Design Guidelines)
if (isset($params['profile']) && is_array($params['profile'])) {
    $params = $params['profile'];
}
```

#### RestController.php
- Updated the alternative profile endpoint implementation to also handle wrapped data
- Ensured consistent behavior between both implementations

### 2. Testing

#### PHPUnit Tests
- Created `ProfileEndpointsTest.php` to test both wrapped and direct formats
- Added tests for edge cases (invalid data, empty requests)

#### Manual Testing Script
- Created `tests/manual/test-profile-api.js` for browser-based testing
- The script tests:
  - Getting the current profile
  - Updating with wrapped format
  - Updating with direct format
  - Verification after each operation

### 3. Documentation Updates

#### API Endpoints Documentation
- Updated `docs/developer/api/endpoints.md` to clarify both formats are supported
- Added examples for both wrapped and direct formats
- Marked wrapped format as preferred following API Design Guidelines

## Testing Results

The implementation was tested with the following test cases:

1. **Wrapped format request**: `{ "profile": { "fitnessLevel": "advanced" } }`
   - ✅ Profile data is properly extracted and saved
   - ✅ Response includes success message

2. **Direct format request**: `{ "fitnessLevel": "intermediate" }`
   - ✅ Profile data is properly saved
   - ✅ Response includes success message

3. **Invalid request**: Malformed JSON
   - ✅ Error is properly returned
   - ✅ No data is modified

4. **Empty request**: `{}`
   - ✅ No error is generated
   - ✅ No data is modified

## Impact and Benefits

1. **Fixed Critical Bug**: Users can now properly save their profile information
2. **Improved Consistency**: API now follows standards defined in API Design Guidelines
3. **Enhanced Documentation**: Better guidance for developers integrating with the API
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code continues to work without changes

## Future Considerations

1. **Standardization**: Consider gradually updating other endpoints to follow the same pattern
2. **Deprecation Strategy**: Create a timeline for deprecating direct format in favor of wrapped format
3. **Validation Enhancement**: Add more robust validation for all profile fields

## Conclusion

This sprint successfully addressed the immediate issue with profile data saving while establishing a foundation for consistent API design patterns across the application. The changes follow the principle of minimal impact while ensuring proper functionality.
