# Workout Editor Bug Report

## Issue Summary
The workout editor modal was successfully opening and displaying the workout title, but the actual exercises (workout content) were not appearing in the editor.

## Root Cause
After investigating the codebase, the root cause was identified in the `convertToEditorFormat` function located in `src/features/workout-generator/types/editor.ts`. 

This function was originally designed to extract exercises **only** from sections with names containing "main" or "workout". However, the sample workout provided has its exercises organized in different section types:

- "Warm Up"
- "Strength Circuit 1"
- "Strength Circuit 2" 
- "Cooldown"

None of these section names matched the original filtering criteria ("main" or "workout"), resulting in no exercises being extracted for the editor.

## The Fix
The solution was to update the `convertToEditorFormat` function to:

1. Process exercises from **all** workout sections instead of just the "main" section
2. Include the section name in the exercise notes to maintain context
3. Handle both sets-based and duration-based exercises
4. Track the total duration by summing up all section durations
5. Add error logging when no exercises are found

## Technical Implementation Details
- Modified the extraction logic to iterate through all sections using `forEach`
- Created unique exercise IDs using section index and exercise index
- Added proper handling for different exercise types (sets/reps vs. timed)
- Included the section name in the exercise notes for better context
- Added a warning to the console if no exercises were extracted

## Verification
The build has been successfully tested and compiled without errors.

## Recommendations
1. Consider enhancing the workout editor UI to display section information more prominently
2. Implement unit tests that verify the editor can handle various workout section structures
3. Add data validation to ensure the workout structure is consistent before attempting conversion
