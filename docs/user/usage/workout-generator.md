# Using the AI Workout Generator

This guide will walk you through the process of creating custom AI-generated workouts using the FitCopilot Generator plugin.

## Generating a Custom Workout

The workout generator uses a step-by-step process to create personalized workouts based on your fitness goals, experience level, and available equipment.

### Step 1: Enter Your Workout Preferences

1. Navigate to the Workout Generator page on your WordPress site.
2. Fill in the following required information:
   - **Fitness Goal**: Choose what you want to achieve (lose weight, build muscle, etc.)
   - **Experience Level**: Select your fitness experience (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
   - **Workout Duration**: Choose how long you want to workout (15-90 minutes)

3. **Advanced Options** (optional):
   - Click the "Advanced Options" panel to expand additional settings
   - Select any equipment you have available
   - Enter any physical restrictions or preferences (e.g., knee injury, prefer low-impact exercises)

4. Click the **Continue** button to proceed to the preview step.

### Step 2: Review Your Workout Parameters

After entering your preferences, you'll see a workout preview that summarizes your selections:

- Your fitness goal will be displayed in blue
- Your experience level will be displayed in green
- Your workout duration will be displayed in purple
- Any selected equipment will be shown as tags
- Any restrictions you've entered will be displayed in a separate section

This preview helps you confirm that you've made the correct selections before generating the full workout.

From this screen, you can:
- Click **Edit Request** to go back and modify your selections
- Click **Generate Workout** to create your personalized workout plan

### Step 3: Generating Your Workout

After clicking "Generate Workout," the system will communicate with the AI to create your personalized workout. This process typically takes 10-30 seconds.

During generation:
- A progress indicator will appear
- Status messages will rotate to keep you informed about the process
- Please be patient and do not refresh the page

### Step 4: Using Your Generated Workout

Once your workout is generated, you'll see the complete workout plan including:

- Workout title and description
- Exercise list with repetitions, sets, and rest periods
- Notes on proper form and technique
- Estimated calorie burn

You can:
- Print the workout
- Save it to your account
- Generate another workout by clicking the "Generate Another Workout" button

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the workout generation process:

- **Form Validation Errors**: Make sure all required fields are filled out
- **Generation Errors**: If the AI fails to generate a workout, try again or slightly modify your request
- **Long Processing Times**: During peak usage, workout generation may take longer than usual
