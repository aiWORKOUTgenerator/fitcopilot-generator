# AdvancedOptionsPanel Infinite Loop Fix

## Issue Summary
The AdvancedOptionsPanel component was causing an infinite loop with continuous re-renders and debug logging, creating performance issues and filling up the console logs.

## Root Cause
The infinite loop was caused by unstable dependencies in a `useEffect` hook:

```typescript
React.useEffect(() => {
  console.log('[AdvancedOptionsPanel] Debug Info:', {
    profileState: state,
    profile: profile,
    profileLoading: profileLoading,
    profileMappingExists: !!profileMapping,
    useProfileType: typeof useProfile,
    profileContextAvailable: !!useProfile,
  });
}, [state, profile, profileLoading, profileMapping]); // ❌ Unstable dependencies
```

### Technical Issues:
1. **`state` object** - Gets recreated on every render from `useProfile()`
2. **`profile` property** - Part of `state`, also changes on every render  
3. **`profileMapping`** - Calculated using `mapProfileToWorkoutContext(profile)`, creating new object every time
4. **Object reference inequality** - Each render creates new object references, triggering useEffect again

## Fix Applied

### 1. Removed Debug Logging
Removed the problematic `useEffect` with unstable dependencies:
```typescript
// Debug logging removed to prevent infinite re-render loop
```

### 2. Memoized Profile Mapping
Added `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary recalculations:
```typescript
// Memoize profile mapping to prevent infinite re-renders
const profileMapping = useMemo(() => {
  return profile ? mapProfileToWorkoutContext(profile) : null;
}, [profile]);
```

### 3. Added Required Import
```typescript
import React, { useState, useMemo } from 'react';
```

## Files Modified
- `src/components/ui/AdvancedOptionsPanel.tsx`

## Results
- ✅ Infinite loop eliminated
- ✅ Console log spam stopped
- ✅ Performance improved
- ✅ Component functionality preserved
- ✅ Build successful with no errors

## Impact
This was a critical performance fix as the infinite loop was causing:
- Browser tab freezing
- Console flooding
- Memory leaks
- Poor user experience
- Debugging difficulties

The fix maintains all original functionality while eliminating the performance-killing infinite render cycle.
