## 🔬 **Data Format Transformation**

### **Legacy Format Example (Before)**
```json
{
  "title": "15-Minute Intermediate Strength Workout (Resistance Bands & TRX)",
  "sections": [
    {
      "name": "Warm Up",
      "duration": 3,
      "exercises": [...]
    }
  ]
  // Missing: exercises array, metadata, standardized structure
}
```

### **Standard Format v1.0 (After)**
```json
{
  "title": "15-Minute Intermediate Strength Workout (Resistance Bands & TRX)",
  "exercises": [],
  "sections": [
    {
      "name": "Warm Up", 
      "duration": 3,
      "exercises": [...]
    }
  ],
  "duration": null,
  "difficulty": "intermediate",
  "equipment": [],
  "goals": [],
  "restrictions": "",
  "metadata": {
    "format_version": "1.0",
    "migrated_at": "2025-05-30 19:01:48",
    "original_format": "custom_legacy",
    "migration_script_version": "1.0"
  }
