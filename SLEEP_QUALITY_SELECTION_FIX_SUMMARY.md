# Sleep Quality Card Selection Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented interactive selection functionality for the Sleep Quality Card in the WorkoutGeneratorGrid component, following the same consistent pattern established for Stress Level, Energy Level, Equipment, and Restrictions cards.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Added Convenience Method to useWorkoutForm Hook
**File**: `src/features/workout-generator/hooks/useWorkoutForm.ts`

Added a new convenience method for session-specific sleep quality management:

```typescript
const setSleepQuality = useCallback((level: number) => {
  const currentSessionInputs = formValues.sessionInputs || {};
  setSessionInputs({
    ...currentSessionInputs,
    sleepQuality: level
  });
}, [formValues.sessionInputs, setSessionInputs]);
```

This method is exported in the hook's return statement and integrates with the existing `SessionSpecificInputs.sleepQuality` field.

### 2. Enhanced WorkoutGeneratorGrid Component
**File**: `src/features/workout-generator/components/Form/WorkoutGeneratorGrid.tsx`

#### Added Hook Integration
```typescript
const {
  // ... existing methods
  setSleepQuality,
  formValues
} = useWorkoutForm();
```

#### Added Event Handler
```typescript
// Sleep quality selection handler
const handleSleepSelection = useCallback((level: number) => {
  console.log('[WorkoutGeneratorGrid] Sleep quality selected:', level);
  setSleepQuality(level);
  setDailySelections(prev => ({ ...prev, sleepQuality: level }));
}, [setSleepQuality]);
```

#### Made Individual Options Interactive

**Sleep Quality Options (6 levels: 1-6)**
- **Level 6**: "Excellent" - Deep, restful sleep all night
- **Level 5**: "Good" - Solid sleep with minimal interruptions  
- **Level 4**: "Fair" - Decent sleep but some restlessness
- **Level 3**: "Poor" - Restless night with frequent waking
- **Level 2**: "Very Poor" - Little sleep, very restless
- **Level 1**: "Terrible" - Almost no sleep, exhausted

Each option now includes:
- `onClick={() => handleSleepSelection(level)}` click handler
- Conditional selected state classes: `${dailySelections.sleepQuality === level ? 'selected' : ''}`
- Maps to `SessionSpecificInputs.sleepQuality` field

### 3. Existing CSS Styles Already Implemented
**File**: `src/features/workout-generator/components/Form/WorkoutGeneratorGrid.scss`

The selected state styles were already implemented with proper purple theming:

```scss
.sleep-option {
  &.selected {
    background: rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.2);
    border-color: rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.5);

    .sleep-label {
      color: rgba(139, 92, 246, 1);
      font-weight: var(--font-weight-semibold, 600);
    }
  }
}
```

## User Experience Features

### Visual Feedback
- **Sleep Quality**: Purple theme (`#8b5cf6`) for selected states
- Hover effects with subtle transforms and color transitions
- Clear visual distinction between selected and unselected states
- Responsive grid layout (3x2 on desktop, 2x3 on mobile)

### State Management
- **Single Selection**: Sleep quality supports single selection (6 levels: 1-6)
- **Real-time Updates**: Selections immediately update local state and form state
- **State Persistence**: Selections persist during session navigation
- **Debug Logging**: Comprehensive console logging for state changes

### Sleep Quality Scale Mapping
The implementation maps descriptive text labels to numeric values for consistent API integration:

| Text Label | Numeric Value | Description |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| Terrible   | 1             | Almost no sleep, exhausted |
| Very Poor  | 2             | Little sleep, very restless |
| Poor       | 3             | Restless night with frequent waking |
| Fair       | 4             | Decent sleep but some restlessness |
| Good       | 5             | Solid sleep with minimal interruptions |
| Excellent  | 6             | Deep, restful sleep all night |

### Integration Points
- **Form Hook**: Direct integration with `useWorkoutForm` convenience method
- **Session Data**: Flows to `SessionSpecificInputs.sleepQuality`
- **Preview Step**: Selected values appear in workout preview
- **API Integration**: Included in workout generation API calls
- **Backend Storage**: Stored as workout metadata for reference

## Data Flow Architecture

```
User Selection → Event Handler → Hook Method → Session Inputs → Form State → API Call → Workout Generation
```

### Sleep Quality Flow
```
handleSleepSelection(level) → setSleepQuality(level) → sessionInputs.sleepQuality → formValues.sessionInputs → API
```

## Consistency Achieved

This implementation maintains perfect consistency with all other WorkoutGeneratorGrid cards:

1. **Event Handler Pattern**: Same `useCallback` structure with debug logging
2. **State Management**: Same local state synchronization approach
3. **Click Handler Integration**: Same `onClick` and conditional className pattern
4. **CSS Architecture**: Same selected state styling approach with theme-appropriate colors
5. **Form Integration**: Same convenience method pattern through `useWorkoutForm` hook
6. **Numeric Mapping**: Consistent 1-6 scale for API integration

## Color Theme Consistency

The sleep quality card follows the established color theme pattern:

- **Focus Options**: Green theme (`#22c55e`) for positive selections
- **Equipment**: Green theme (`#10b981`) for positive selections  
- **Restrictions**: Yellow-amber theme (`#fbbf24`) for warnings
- **Stress Level**: Blue theme (`#3b82f6`) for mood tracking
- **Energy Level**: Green theme (`#22c55e`) for energy tracking
- **Sleep Quality**: Purple theme (`#8b5cf6`) for rest quality tracking

## Technical Benefits

- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript compliance with existing interfaces
- **Performance**: Optimized with `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Accessibility**: Maintains existing hover states and visual feedback
- **Backward Compatibility**: No breaking changes to existing functionality
- **State Isolation**: Clean separation between local UI state and form state

## Testing Validation

The implementation supports the same testing patterns as other cards:

1. ✅ Click any sleep quality option → immediately shows selected state
2. ✅ Selections persist during session navigation
3. ✅ Multiple clicks properly update selection (single-select behavior)
4. ✅ State flows to preview step display
5. ✅ Debug logging provides clear tracking
6. ✅ API calls include session inputs correctly
7. ✅ Numeric values map correctly (Excellent=6, Terrible=1)

## Completion Status

✅ **Sleep Quality Card**: Fully interactive with 6 selectable levels  
✅ **Form Integration**: Complete integration with session data flow  
✅ **State Management**: Consistent with existing card patterns  
✅ **Visual Design**: Maintains design system consistency with purple theme  
✅ **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript compliance  
✅ **CSS Styles**: All selected state styles already implemented  

The Sleep Quality Card now provides the same professional, interactive experience as all other WorkoutGeneratorGrid cards, completing another piece of the comprehensive daily workout customization interface.

## Workout Context Integration

Sleep quality selections will enhance AI workout generation by providing context about the user's rest and recovery state:

- **Excellent/Good Sleep**: AI can recommend higher intensity workouts
- **Fair Sleep**: AI balances workout intensity appropriately  
- **Poor/Very Poor/Terrible Sleep**: AI recommends recovery-focused, lower intensity workouts

This creates a more personalized and responsive workout generation experience that adapts to the user's daily recovery state.
