# Equipment Selection Persistence Fix

## 🔍 **Issue Identified**

The Equipment section selections were not persisting because:

1. **Only header badges were interactive**: The profile equipment badges in the header section had click handlers and selected states
2. **Body section was display-only**: The 12 equipment options in the body grid (equipment-options-grid) were missing:
   - Click handlers (`onClick` events)
   - Selected state classes (`${dailySelections.equipmentAvailableToday?.includes(equipment) ? 'selected' : ''}`)
   - Interactive functionality

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Added Click Handlers to All Equipment Options**
**File**: `src/features/workout-generator/components/Form/WorkoutGeneratorGrid.tsx`

**Before**:
```typescript
<div className="equipment-option" title="Dumbbells" data-equipment="dumbbells">
  <span className="equipment-label">Dumbbells</span>
</div>
```

**After**:
```typescript
<div 
  className={`equipment-option ${dailySelections.equipmentAvailableToday?.includes('dumbbells') ? 'selected' : ''}`}
  onClick={() => handleEquipmentToggle('dumbbells')}
  title="Dumbbells"
>
  <span className="equipment-label">Dumbbells</span>
</div>
```

### **2. Applied to All 12 Equipment Options**
- ✅ No Equipment (`none`)
- ✅ Dumbbells (`dumbbells`)
- ✅ Kettlebells (`kettlebells`)
- ✅ Resistance Bands (`resistance-bands`)
- ✅ Pull-up Bar (`pull-up-bar`)
- ✅ Yoga Mat (`yoga-mat`)
- ✅ Weight Bench (`bench`)
- ✅ Barbell (`barbell`)
- ✅ TRX (`trx`)
- ✅ Medicine Ball (`medicine-ball`)
- ✅ Jump Rope (`jump-rope`)
- ✅ Stability Ball (`stability-ball`)

### **3. Updated CSS Selected State Styling**
**File**: `src/features/workout-generator/components/Form/WorkoutGeneratorGrid.scss`

**Enhanced the `.equipment-option.selected` styles**:
```scss
&.selected {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #10b981 0%, #22c55e 100%) !important;
  border-color: #10b981 !important;
  color: white !important;
  box-shadow: 
    0 4px 12px rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.3),
    0 0 0 2px rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.2);
  transform: translateY(-1px);

  .equipment-label {
    color: white !important;
    font-weight: var(--font-weight-semibold, 600);
  }

  &:hover {
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #059669 0%, #16a34a 100%) !important;
    box-shadow: 
      0 6px 16px rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.4),
      0 0 0 2px rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.3);
  }
}
```

## 🎯 **How Equipment Selection Now Works**

### **Dual Selection Areas**
1. **Header Profile Badges**: Quick selection from user's profile equipment (top 3 items)
2. **Body Grid Options**: Full selection from all 12 available equipment types

### **Multi-Select Functionality**
- ✅ **Toggle Selection**: Click to add/remove equipment
- ✅ **Visual Feedback**: Selected items show emerald gradient background
- ✅ **State Persistence**: Selections persist during session
- ✅ **Form Integration**: Updates `equipmentAvailableToday` array in session inputs

### **Equipment Handler Logic**
```typescript
const handleEquipmentToggle = useCallback((equipment: string) => {
  const currentEquipment = dailySelections.equipmentAvailableToday || [];
  const isSelected = currentEquipment.includes(equipment);
  
  const newEquipment = isSelected 
    ? currentEquipment.filter(e => e !== equipment)  // Remove if selected
    : [...currentEquipment, equipment];              // Add if not selected
    
  console.log('[WorkoutGeneratorGrid] Equipment toggled:', { equipment, isSelected, newEquipment });
  setEquipmentAvailableToday(newEquipment);          // Update form state
  setDailySelections(prev => ({ ...prev, equipmentAvailableToday: newEquipment })); // Update local state
}, [setEquipmentAvailableToday, dailySelections.equipmentAvailableToday]);
```

## ✅ **Testing Verification**

### **Expected Behavior**:
1. **Click any equipment option** → Immediately shows selected state (emerald background)
2. **Click again** → Deselects and returns to normal state
3. **Select multiple equipment** → All selections persist and display correctly
4. **Navigate away and back** → Selections remain during session
5. **Generate workout** → Equipment selections included in `sessionInputs.equipmentAvailableToday`

### **Debug Logging**:
Check browser console for:
```
[WorkoutGeneratorGrid] Equipment toggled: { equipment: 'dumbbells', isSelected: false, newEquipment: ['dumbbells'] }
[WorkoutGeneratorGrid] Daily selections state: { dailySelections: {...}, formSessionInputs: {...} }
```

## 🎉 **Fix Complete**

Equipment selection now works consistently across both:
- ✅ **Profile equipment badges** (header section)
- ✅ **Full equipment grid** (body section)

Users can now successfully select and persist their daily equipment preferences, and these will flow through to workout generation and be stored in the workout metadata.

**The Equipment section selection persistence issue has been resolved!**
